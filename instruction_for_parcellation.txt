(If the FSL has been installed properly, we should have this file 'MNI152_T1_1mm_brain.nii.gz'. We will be able to find this by starting fsleyes and then 'File'->'Add Standard')

#The previous step produced the registered output brain (t1_mni.nii.gz) and a file containing the transformation (rotation, shrinkage etc) that was carried out (affine). Now we use these intsructions to move the parcellation into the same space.
> flirt -interp nearestneighbour -in t1_corrected_NeuroMorph_Parcellation.nii.gz -ref /usr/local/fsl/data/standard/MNI152_T1_1mm_brain.nii.gz -applyxfm -init affine -out t1_parcellation_mni

#Almost done! One of the 'labels' in the parcellation is 'CSF' which we want to get rid of for better visualization
> fslmaths t1_parcellation_mni.nii.gz -thr 5 t1_parcellation_mni_v2

#Done! Now we have your parcellation in MNI space!

#With the file (t1_parcellation_mni_v2.nii.gz) we can then run the python scripts to map the allen data to the NM labels (data-preprocessing).
